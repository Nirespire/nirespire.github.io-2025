In a [previous post](https://medium.com/@nirespire/what-is-cicd-concepts-in-continuous-integration-and-deployment-4fe3f6625007) about continuous integration and deployment, I alluded to the practice of constantly putting code through various tests and making the results visible, whether within a software team or to the public for an opensource project. In this post, I want to dive a little deeper into what "testing" *actually* is in the context of writing quality software. Specifically, I'd like to shed some light on the different types of testing and how they can help you write better software.

### Unit Testing

> Absolute unit

Unit testing is the lowest level of testing. It's about as simple as you can get when testing software, but don't discount its value. A few simple unit tests can go a long way to keep your codebase robust, bug-free, and maintainable over time.
