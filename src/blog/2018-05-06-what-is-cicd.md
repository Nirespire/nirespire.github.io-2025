If you work in software development, you've probably heard the term "CICD" thrown around. It stands for Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (or Delivery), and it's become an essential practice in modern software development. In this post, I'll break down what CICD is and why it's important.

## What is Continuous Integration?

Continuous Integration (CI) is the practice of frequently merging code changes into a central repository, after which automated builds and tests are run. The goal is to find and address integration issues quickly, improve software quality, and reduce the time it takes to validate and release new software updates.

The key principles of CI include:
- Maintaining a single source repository
- Automating the build process
- Making the build self-testing
- Everyone commits to the baseline every day
- Every commit triggers an automated build and test
- Keep the build fast
- Test in a clone of the production environment
- Make it easy to get the latest deliverables
- Everyone can see the results of the latest build
- Automate deployment
