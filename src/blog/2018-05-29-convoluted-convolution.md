Deep learning and neural networks are some of the hottest topics in tech right now. Companies are investing heavily in machine learning research and development, looking for ways to make their products and services smarter through AI. One of the most successful applications of deep learning has been in the field of computer vision, specifically through the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## What is Convolution?

In mathematics, convolution is an operation between two functions that produces a third function expressing how the shape of one is modified by the other. In the context of image processing and computer vision, convolution is the process of applying a filter (or kernel) to an image to create a new, transformed image.

The process works by sliding the filter across the image, performing element-wise multiplication between the filter values and the corresponding pixel values, and then summing up the results. This operation helps in detecting various features in the image such as edges, textures, and patterns.
