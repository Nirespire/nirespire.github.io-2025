As a student or recent graduate, career fairs can be intimidating. You're competing with hundreds of other candidates for the attention of recruiters who might only spend a few minutes with each person. Having a strong personal project can help you stand out and demonstrate your skills in a practical way.

A personal project serves multiple purposes:
- Demonstrates initiative and passion for programming
- Shows practical application of your skills
- Gives you something concrete to discuss in interviews
