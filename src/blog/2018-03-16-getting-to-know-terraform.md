In the modern age of cloud computing, infrastructure management has become increasingly complex. Gone are the days of managing a handful of physical servers in a data center. Today's applications are built on dozens or even hundreds of cloud resources across multiple providers. This is where Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform come in.

## What is Terraform?

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool created by HashiCorp. It enables users to define and provision data center infrastructure using a declarative configuration language known as HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), or optionally JSON.

The key features that make Terraform powerful include:

- Platform agnostic
- State management
- Plan and predict changes
- Dependency graph
- Modular configurations
