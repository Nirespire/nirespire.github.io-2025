January has been a month of reflection and recalibration. As we turn the page on another year, I've found myself thinking deeply about what it means to build sustainable practices—both in leadership and in life. The new year energy is real, but I've learned to channel it into systems rather than resolutions.

This month, I've been particularly focused on the intersection of AI tooling and developer productivity. With the rapid evolution of AI coding assistants, leaders are facing new questions about team composition, skill development, and what "expertise" even means in an era of augmented development. It's a fascinating time to be thinking about these problems, and I'm excited to share some of the ideas that have been shaping my perspective.
